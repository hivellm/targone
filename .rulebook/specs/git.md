**AI Assistant Git Push Mode**: MANUAL

**CRITICAL**: Never execute `git push` commands automatically.
Always provide push commands for manual execution by the user.

Example:
```
✋ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED:
Run these commands manually (SSH password may be required):
  git push origin main
  git push origin v1.0.0
```

# Git Workflow Rules

## Allow-list (always safe — no authorization needed)

`status` · `diff` · `log` · `blame` · `add <files>` · `commit` (after quality
checks) · `branch`/`tag` (list only)

## Forbidden (require explicit user authorization)

| Command | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `stash` | hidden state gets forgotten |
| `rebase` | rewrites history |
| `reset --hard` | destroys uncommitted changes |
| `checkout -- .` / `restore .` | discards all changes |
| `merge`/`rebase` into the DEFAULT branch | goes through an approved PR, never directly |
| `branch -D` | permanent branch deletion |
| `push --force` | overwrites remote — NEVER on main/master |
| `clean -f` | permanently deletes untracked files |
| switching a SHARED checkout with foreign changes | breaks concurrent sessions — use `git worktree` |
| `rm -rf` on a computed/variable path | one empty or wrong segment reaches the repo root — verify non-empty and not the root first |
| deleting, moving, or overwriting `.git` | destroys history and reflog; no task ever requires it |

Multiple AI sessions may share the same working tree — destructive operations
affect ALL of them. Never commit with `--no-verify`.

## Worktrees

- **Place them outside the repository tree**: `git worktree add ../<repo>-wt-<name>`.
  `git worktree add ./wt` succeeds and nests the worktree under the repo root —
  from then on any cleanup that resolves one level wrong takes the root, and
  `.git` with it.
- **Remove with `git worktree remove <path>`, then `git worktree prune`.** Never
  `rm -rf` a worktree path: `worktree remove` refuses to touch the main worktree,
  `rm -rf` does not.
- `git worktree add` is safe on its own — git rejects empty, `.` and `..` paths.
  The destruction is always in the cleanup step, never in the add.

## Commits

- Conventional Commits, English only: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — types:
  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
- Per commit: type-check + lint + tests covering the change. Per push/PR:
  the full quality gate — all green.
- Commit only what the task touched; review `git status` + `git diff` first.
- Never commit generated artifacts (dist/, build/, node_modules/, coverage/).

## Branches

- Default branch: `main`. Feature work on `feat/<name>`, fixes on
  `fix/<name>`, releases on `release/vX.Y.Z`.
- Branch freely for your own work and open PRs for review. Create/switch/merge
  YOUR agent-created branches autonomously; prefer `git worktree` for parallel
  agents, under the placement and removal rules above. Never switch a shared
  checkout that has changes you did not author.
